# Crypto Sleuth React App

Created a cryptocurrency web app using create-react-app framework that enables real-time tracking of 100's of cryptos in a rank-wise order by their market capitalization.
<br>
<br>
For each crypto the web application includes: <br>
 1. the difference for last 1 hour, 24 hour, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days and 1 year <br>
 2. Also added a market high and low for that particular day <br>
 3. The Market Cap and Supply <br>
 4. A Chart for comparing the increase or decrease in the past 365 days for any particular crypto currency, <br>
    this also helps people make better informed decisions on whether to buy it.
 5. Also an about section for each cryptocurrency for users to understand better about it.


Tech tools used: HTML+CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Chart.js, Axios, CoinGecko API.
